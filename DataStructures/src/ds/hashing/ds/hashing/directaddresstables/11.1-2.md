## 11.1-2

If we have a bit vector, each index will represent a key and its value will represent whether or not we have the key in the vector or not.

```bitVector[i] == 1``` *We have element in the vector*

`bitVector[i] == 0` *We don't have element in the vector*

### Insertion

We can insert the element in `O(1)` . 

`bitVector[i] |= 1`

### Deletion

We can delete the element in `O(1)` . 

`bitVector[i] &= 0`

### Search

We can search the element in `O(1)` . 

`bitVector[i] == 1`

### Caveat

We need to know the max length of the vector or the size of the known universe of keys to actually create this vector.
