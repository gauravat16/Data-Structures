# 11.1-3

Implementing a direct address table where keys arent unique requires us to have a list like structure attached to every key as a satellite data.

This list can be a linked list to manage memory well. To support `O(n)` deletions we need a this linked list to be a doubly linked list.

`INSERT`

Insertion in a linked list is `O(n)` .

`DELETE`

Deletion is in `O(n)` as every node has pointers to next and previous node.

`SEARCH`

Search takes `O(n)` because we return the `HEAD` of the linked list.
